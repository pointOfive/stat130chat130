    "A reasonable characterization of STA130 Homework is that it simply defines a weekly reading comprehension assignment. \n",
    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",
    "However, rather than reading a textbook, STA130 Homework is based on ChatBots so students can interactively follow up to clarify questions or confusion that they may still have regarding learning objective assignments.\n",

    "It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to \"do the work for you\". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

One place \"statistics\" can be used to decieve is through misuse of charts.  As discussed [here](https://handsondataviz.org/how-to-lie-with-charts.html) and many other places, a primary tactic that can be used to give a misleading impression using a chart is the manipulation of axes or the addition of additional dimensions which distort the meaning of size. **What are the problems with the following graphs?**\n",
