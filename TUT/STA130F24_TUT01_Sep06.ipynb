    "8. This problem will guide you through exploring how to use a ChatBot to troubleshoot code using the \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv\" data set. Give brief explanations in your own words for any requested answers to the questions below. \n",
    "    > To initialially constrain the scope of the reponses from your ChatChat, start a new ChatBot session with the following slight variation on the initial prompting approach from \"2\" above\n",
    "    > - \"I am going to do some initial simple summary analyses on the titanic data set I've downloaded (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv) which has some missing values, and I'd like to get your help understanding the code I'm using and the analysis it's performing\"\n",
    "    > \n",
    "    > > Remember, ChatGPT will allow you to upload your data, but for this class we don't want ChatGPT to just do the analysis for us. **DO NOT purchase an upgrade of ChatGPT**. We instead want ChatBots to help us understand the steps we need to take to analyze the data. \n",
    "    > > - [Copilot Pro](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) which you have access to through your UofT account is anyway based on [ChatGPT4.0](https://chat.openai.com/)...   \n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Use your ChatBot session to understand what `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()` does and then demonstrate and explain this using a different example from your data set other than what the ChatBot automatically provide for you\n",
    "        > If needed, you can help guide the ChatBot by showing it the code you've used to download the data **AND provide it with the names of the columns** using either a summary of the data with `df.describe()` or just `df.columns` as demonstrated [here](../CHATLOG/COP/00017_copilot_groupby.md)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question \"7\" above, `df.describe()` would have different values in the `count` value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data.  Why do these capture something fundamentally different from the values in the `count` that result from doing something like `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "        > - Questions \"4\" and \"6\" above address how missing values are handled by `df.describe()` (which is reflected in the `count` output of this method); but, `count` in conjunction with `group_by` has another primary function that's more important than addressing missing values (although missing data could still play a role here).\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors \n",
    "        > First share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT\n",
    "    \n",
    "        1. Forget to include `import pandas as pd` in your code \n",
    "            > Use Kernel->Restart from the notebook menu to restart the jupyter notebook session unload imported libraries and start over so you can create this error\n",
    "            >  - When python has an error, it sometimes provides a lot of \"stack trace\" output, but that's not usually very important for troubleshooting. For this problem for example, all you need to share with ChatGPT or search on google is `\"NameError: name 'pd' is not defined\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. Mistype \"titanic.csv\" as \"titanics.csv\" \n",
    "            1. If ChatBot troubleshooting is based on downloading the file, just replace the whole url with \"titanics.csv\" and try to troubleshoot the subsequent `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'titanics.csv'` (assuming the file is indeed not present)\n",
    "            2. Explore introducing typos into a couple other parts of the url and note the slightly different errors this produces\n",
    "      \n",
    "        3. Try to use a dataframe before it's been assigned into the variable\n",
    "            > You can simulate this by just misnaming the variable. For example, if you should write `df.group_by(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()` based on how you loaded the data, then instead write `DF.group_by(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`\n",

    "        \n",

    "        \n",
    "        5. Mistype one of the names of the chained functions with the code \n",
    "            > For example, try something like `df.group_by(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()` and `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describle()`\n",
    "        \n",
    "        6. Use a column name that's not in your data for the `groupby` and column selection \n",

    "        \n",
    "        7. Forget to put the column name as a string in quotes for the `groupby` and column selection, and see if the ChatBot and google are still as helpful as they were for the previous question\n",

Have you reviewed the course [wiki-textbook](https://github.com/pointOfive/STA130_ChatGPT/wiki) and interacted with a ChatBot (or, if that wasn't sufficient, real people in the course piazza discussion board or TA office hours) to help you understand all the material in the tutorial and lecture that you didn't quite follow when you first saw it? \n",
    "> Just answering \"Yes\" or \"No\" or \"Somewhat\" or \"Mostly\" or whatever here is fine as this question isn't a part of the rubric; but, the midterm and final exams may ask questions that are based on the tutorial and lecture materials; and, your own skills will be limited by your familiarity with these materials (which will determine your ability to actually do actual things effectively with these skills... like the course project...)"
