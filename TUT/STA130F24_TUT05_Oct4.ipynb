    "  - Consider the same pharmaceutical company testing a new drug. The null hypothesis $H_0$ is that the drug is no more effective than the placebo, and the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ is that the drug is more effective.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> The thing is though, once you understand a p-value is, then you'll see how simple and elegant the above definition is... So, your objective in learning what a p-value is should be to be able to read and understand the definition of a p-value given above effortlessly... That way you can communicate with the language of statistical reasoning in 3.5 seconds rather than 3.5 minutes...\n",
