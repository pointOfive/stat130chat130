    "- For each spin of the wheel, two gamblers take part. For a toonie each (\\\\$2 Canadian), Stella sells one a red ticket and one a black ticket  (i.e., total \\\\$4). Then Stella spins the Wheel of Destiny. The person who holds the colour on which the spinner stops gets \\\\$3.50 (Stella keeps \\\\$0.50 per spin for running the game and providing snacks).\n",

Before she beings using this spinner, she wants to make sure that it is, in fact, fair (meaning, she wants both colours to come up equally often). Because of the set-up of the game, Stella has no incentive to cheat and wants the game to be as fair as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything phystical and mechanical that Stella can examine about the wheel seems fine; there is the same number of sectors of each colour and they each have the same area. BUT! Stella has a great idea and decides to come to YOU, her statistical guru, and ask you to verify that the new spinner is fit to use. Is Stella's game is \"fair\" (even if somewhat illegal)?\n",
