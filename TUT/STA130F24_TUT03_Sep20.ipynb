    "#### 1. Use the [penguins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv) dataset to demonstrate [bar plots](https://plotly.com/python/bar-charts/), [histograms](https://plotly.com/python/histograms/), and [box plots](https://plotly.com/python/box-plots/) using [_plotly_](https://plotly.com/python/) in a Jupyter notebook: click the links for the different types of plots, and figure out how to make the plot using some example from the [penguins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv) dataset\n",

    "2. Discuss the \"bins\" (`nbins`) parameter (demonstrated [here](https://plotly.com/python/histograms/#choosing-the-number-of-bins))\n",
    "3. Discuss how to \"read a box plot\" by explaining what the different parts of a box plot mean\n",

If time permits, it might be helpful to use some alternative datasets to illustrate skew ([tips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/tips.csv)), outliers ([fraud](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsethi31/Kaggle-Data-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection/master/creditcard.csv)), and true modality ([old faithful](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/hogwild/c2704a1ae38c0a36983bc13121050dac/raw/7fd577be21752939375d92cd3a808558106e903b/oldFaithfulGeyserDataset.csv)) (as opposed to the modality from subpopulations, like how the modality in the penguins data goes away if you're looking only at individual species)\n",
