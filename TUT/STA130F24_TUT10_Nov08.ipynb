    "1. Two (or more) **indicator predictor variables** corresponding to THREE (or more) groups based on so called \"contrasts\" (or \"offsets\") from an (arbitrarily chosen) \"baseline\" group<br><br>\n",
    "  $$\\large Y_i = \\beta_{\\textrm{A}} + 1_{[x_i=\\textrm{\"B\"}]}(x_i)\\beta_{\\textrm{B-offset}} + 1_{[x_i=\\textrm{\"C\"}]}(x_i)\\beta_{\\textrm{C-offset}} + \\epsilon_i \\quad \\text{ where } \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal N\\left(0, \\sigma^2\\right)$$<br>\n",

    "2. Both **indicator** and **continuous predictor variables** together in a \"parallel lines\" specification where the number of such lines increases by one for each **indicator predictor variables**<br><br>\n",
    "  $$\\large Y_i = \\beta_{\\textrm{A}} + 1_{[x_i=\\textrm{\"B\"}]}(x_i)\\beta_{\\textrm{B-offset}} + \\beta_z z_{i} + \\epsilon_i \\quad \\text{ where } \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal N\\left(0, \\sigma^2\\right)$$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Within each of the groups induced by the **indicator variables(s)**, the coefficient $\\beta_z$ is (of course) still interpreted as \"the average change in the outcome variable for a one-unit increase in the $z_{k}$ predictor variable\" but there is now also an additional difference \"on average\" (of $\\beta_{\\textrm{B-offset}}$ between groups \"A\" and \"B\" in this example) which is what produces the \"parallel lines\" nature of this specification<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Two (or more) **continuous predictor variables**, say $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ (with $z_{1i}$ and $z_{2i}$ representing observation $i$), specifying simultaneous linear relationships with the outcome variable occurring in concert<br><br>\n",
    "  $$\\large Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 z_{1i} + \\beta_2 z_{2i} + \\epsilon_i \\quad \\text{ where } \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal N\\left(0, \\sigma^2\\right)$$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Coefficients $\\beta_k$ are still interpreted as \"the average change in the outcome variable for a one-unit increase in the $z_{k}$ predictor variable\" but now we should be careful to additionally add the stipulation \"with all other predictor variables held constant\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interactions** (not to be confused with **indicator predictor variables**) between **continuous** and **indicator predictor variables** allowing the strength of the \"linear relationship\" between the **outcome variable** and the **continuous predictor variables** to be different within different groups, creating a \"non-parallel lines\" behavior\n",

    "\n",
    "    - So the coefficient $\\beta_z$ is (still) interpreted as \"the average change in the outcome variable for a one-unit increase in the $z$ predictor variable within the baseline group\" but now this \"average change\" is different in other groups, so (for this example), \"the average change in the outcome variable for a one-unit increase in the $z$ predictor variable WITHIN GROUP 'B' is $\\beta_z + \\beta_{\\textrm{z-change-in-B}}$\"<br><br>\n",
    "    - And there remains here as well an additional difference \"on average\" (of $\\beta_{\\textrm{B-offset}}$ between groups \"A\" and \"B\" in this example) allowing the \"non-parallel lines\" to have different vertical shifts vertically as well as have different slopes<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interactions** between **continuous predictor variables** creating a \"synergistic\" behavior between the **predictor variables** by which \"the average change in the outcome variable for a one-unit increase in one $z_k$ predictor variable depends on the value of another $z_{k'}$ predictor variable (assuming this other $z_{k'}$ predictor variable is held constant)\"<br><br>\n",
    "  $$\\large Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 z_{1i} + \\beta_2 z_{2i} + \\beta_{12} z_{1i} \\times z_{2i} + \\epsilon_i \\quad \\text{ where } \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal N\\left(0, \\sigma^2\\right)$$<br>\n",

    "    - For this example, \"the average change in the outcome variable for a one-unit increase in the $z_{1}$  predictor variable (assuming $z_{2}$ predictor variable is held constant) is $\\beta_1 + \\beta_{12} z_{2}$\" which can be seen to \"synergistically\" depend on the (fixed) value of $z_{2}$\n",
    "    - And conversely, \"the average change in the outcome variable for a one-unit increase in the $z_{2}$  predictor variable (assuming $z_{1}$ predictor variable is held constant) is $\\beta_1 + \\beta_{12} z_{1}$\" which can be seen to \"synergistically\" depend on the (fixed) value of $z_{1}$<br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "6. Reading these **multiple linear regression** model specifications just requires understanding straight up simple math... the equations mean exactly what they say and should be interpreted as such; however, that said...\n",
    "\n",
    "    - One thing to be sure to keep in mind when you're interpreting the equations, though, is that you interpret them with respect to one variable at a time, under the assumption \"with all other predictor variables held constant\"\n",
    "    - This \"with all other predictor variables held constant\" assumption is \"theoretical\" in the sense that in observed data you probably can't \"make a one-unit change to just one predictor variable while simultanesouly holding all other predictor variables constant\"\n",
    "    - But, from the perspective of the mathematical equation, you can indeed \"theoretically\" consider this possibility, and this is indeed the perspective that is used to interpret the relationship of each single predictor variable with the outcome on a one-by-one, case-by-case basis\n"
