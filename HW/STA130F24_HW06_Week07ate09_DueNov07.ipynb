    "The TUT and HW both addressed some of the assumptions used in **Simple Linear Regression**. The **p-values** provided by `statsmodels` via `smf.ols(...).fit()` depend on these assumptions, so if they are not (at least approximately) correct, the **p-values** (and any subsequent claims regarding the \"evidience against\" the **null hypothesis**) are not reliable. In light of this consideration, describe how you could diagnostically check the first three assumptions (given below) when using analyses based on **Simple Linear regression** model. From an Ethical and Professional perspective, do you think doing diagnostic checks on the assumptions of a **Simple Linear regression** model is something you can and should do whenever you're doing this kind of analysis? \n",
