    "At this point in the course you should be able to compute a bootstrap confidence interval for the (candian) population mean of a numeric variable of the sample of the Canadian Social Connection Survey. On the basis of only using the techniques we've encountered in the course so far, it would only be possible to assess a null hypothesis of \"no effect\" if we had \"paired\" (e.g., \"before and after\") measurements in our data; but, we could of course assess a hypothesized parameter value estimated by the bootstrapped confidence interval of a relevant sample statistic...\n",

Consider whether or not we have \"paired\" (e.g., \"before and after\") measurements in our data which could be used to assess a null hypothesis of \"no effect\" (in the manner of the \"Pre-lecture\" HW video above); and, if such data is available, create a confidence interval for the average sample difference and use it to assess a null hypothesis of \"no effect\".\n",

[For Advanced Students Only] There are two factors that go into the uncertainty of sample means: the standard deviation of the original sample and the size of the sample (and they create a standard error of the mean that is theoretically \"the standard deviation of the original sample divided by the square root of n\").  Compute the theoretical standard errors of the sample mean for the different variables you've considered; and, if they're different, confirm that they influence the (variance/uncertainty) bootstrapped sampling distribution of the mean as expected\n",
